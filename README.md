# HMC
Improving Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with adaptive step symplectic integrators.

Jupyter notebook Class_Dev is a scratch notebook for developing the classes contained in: 
-hamiltonian_montecarlo.py
-stormer_verlet.py

Development should focus on .py files.

stormer_verlet.py is the template for developing the adaptive stormer verlet class.
